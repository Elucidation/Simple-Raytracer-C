Simple raytracer written using C++.
There may be some artifacts due to using Visual Studio.
This was back before I understood that fully, but you should be able to go to release and run the SimplerVector.exe to generate output data.
Input was hardcoded at the time, the source code is mainProg.cpp located in SimplerVector/
